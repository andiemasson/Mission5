<div class="art-description">
    <p>I started oil painting when I was 13 years old. The top right picture is the largest piece I’ve ever created — measuring 3x4 feet, taking nearly four months to complete! It was eventually sold at the Springville Museum of Art during my junior year of high school.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The other paintings above were made either for fun or as gifts and commissions. These days, I prefer watercolor because it’s much faster than oil painting. While I still take the occasional oil painting commission, I’d love to explore teaching art in the future!</p>
